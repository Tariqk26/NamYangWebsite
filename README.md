# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## The Process

I set out to create a simple website for the Worthing branch of my kickboxing club - Nam Yang Brighton. I did this because I wanted to help out my club with the launch of their new site. But also because I saw it as an opportunity to have a project where I could get to grips with certain tools I wanted to use. It felt like a useful exchange and a project I could really learn from. The goal of the project was to have a simple website made up of 4 pages. A homepage, About us, Timetable and a Contact us page. 

One of the things that I got to grips with was understanding how props work in react. This took some time to understand that whilst props could be called anything when using them, it makes sense to use specific words when defining them. This makes my code more legible and specific for anyone that might read or review it. I worked through this by working out the `Button` component.

## The Tools

For this project the tools I used were: 
- create-react-ap
- react
- classnames
- trello 

React was something I wanted to learn because it seemed like a cool tool to build websites with, My friend who's a front-end developer reccomended it might be a good place for me to play around in and utilise knowledge that I've been learning through my html and javascript courses. I also wanted to gain expierence with different packages. 

I found using jsx similar to html, which made the language a bit more familiar and less daunting. 

The react router implementation was one of the hardest parts of this project. I did some reading through the react router documentation and this helped me figure some things out however next time I think I would look up some more tutorials and presentations on implementing react router to get more familiar with it. 

## To Do 

1. Look into the best way to implement a Timetable on the 'Timetable' page. 
2. Execute the timetable implementation. 
3. Look into the best way to implement a google map in the 'Contact Us' page. 
4. Execute the google map implementation.
